Yo! Say, the summer makes my heart pound,
With all those bare-legged mermaids around tempting me.
I'll strut my stuff and if I get some results,
I think real love will come my way for sure.
I know you're on to me,
Because of the stylish way you dress.
The feelings become waterproof
All in one fast, dazzling instant.

A hot wind lures my heart away and strips it naked.
I've got nothing to lose, and you're next on my list this scandalous summer.

The fairies make summer come to life.
With all those bare-legged mermaids around tempting me.
I'll strut my stuff and if I get some results,
Will I find real love?

Without you I tend to grow restless,
This hot city is so boring.
If you let your guard down for an instant, I'll pounce on you.
I don't want to use dumb pickup lines.

Just as the fireworks color the nights in the tropics,
If you really wanna burst on fire, then let's make love until we burn to a crisp.

I want to do summer like the fairies do.
My hot desire is like a tornado.
I'll be gentle with you; I want you to know the real me.
As long as it's you I'm with, it's all right.

The sea of buildings in this city are stopping your desire.
I'll make you mine with a kiss of chilled wine.

The fairies make summer come to life.
With mermaids who show their legs and belly-buttons.
About being defeated by love and not showing up to work,
Daisuke says it's ALL OKAY!

Yo! Say, who do you want to spend the summer with?
You can say goodbye to lonely nights sleeping alone.
It is a feeling that goes deep down and will not fade.
Would you like to have that kind of love?
